```json

    "timestamp": "string",
    "payload": {
        "any": "any"
    }
}
```

## Interactions

Interactions stream into the system from various sources (point of sale systems, partner web sites/mobile apps, IoT devices, etc).

They may be sent in batch, API endpoint, or other.

```json
{
    "type": "string",
    "timestamp": "string",
    "origin": {
        "id": "string",
        "type": "string"
    },
    "actor": {
        "id": "string",
        "type": "string"
    },
    "target": {
        "id": "string",
        "type": "string"
    }
}
```

Interactions (the value of `interaction.type`) can be one of the following:

| Value    | Description                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| PURCHACE | User bought the target thing                            |
